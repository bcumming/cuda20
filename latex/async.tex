\begin{frame}[fragile]{Concurrency}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \emph{Concurrency} is the ability to perform multiple CUDA operations simultaneously, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CUDA kernels;
        \item Copying from host to device;
        \item Copying from device to host;
        \item Operations on the host CPU.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{info}{Concurrency enables}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Both CPU and GPU can work at the same time.
            \item Multiple tasks can be run on GPU simultaneously.
            \item Overlapping of communication and computation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{info}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The CUDA language and runtime libraries provide mechanisms for coordinating asynchronous GPU execution:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{CUDA streams} can concurrently run independent kernels and memory transfers;
        \item \emph{CUDA events} can be used to synchronize streams and query the status of kernels and transfers.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Streams}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    A CUDA stream is a sequence of operations that execute in \emph{issue order} on the GPU.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CUDA operations are kernels and copies between host and device memory spaces.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{info}{Streams and concurrency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Operations in different streams \emph{may} run concurrently
            \begin{itemize}
                \item requires sufficient resources on the GPU (registers, shared memory, SMXs, etc).
            \end{itemize}
            \item Operations in the same stream \emph{are} executed sequentially.
            \item If no stream is specified, all kernels are launched in the default stream.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{info}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Managing streams}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    A stream is represented using a \lst{cudaStream_t} type
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \lst{cudaStreamCreate(cudaStream_t* s)} and \lst{cudaStreamDestroy(cudaStream_t s)} can be used to create and free CUDA streams respectively.
        \item To launch a kernel on a stream specify the stream id as a fourth parameter to the launch syntax: \\
            \begin{center} \lst{kernel``<<<``grid_dim, block_dim, shared_size, stream``>>>``(...)} \end{center}
        \item The default CUDA stream is the \lst{NULL} stream, or stream 0 (\lst{cudaStream_t} is an integer).
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{code}{Basic cuda stream usage}
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=boxcudatiny]
// create stream
cudaStream_t stream;
cudaStreamCreate(&stream);
// launch kernel in stream
my_kernel@<<<@grid_dim, block_dim, shared_size, stream@>>>@(..)
// release stream when finished
cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
        \end{lstlisting}
\end{code}

                \item \emph{Note} \lst{kernel_2} will only run concurrently if there are sufficient resources available on the GPU, i.e. if \lst{kernel_1} is not using all of the SMXs.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Takes an additional parameter stream, which is 0 by default.
        \item Returns immediately after initiating copy:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Host can do work while copy is performed;
            \item Only if \emph{pinned memory} is used.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Copies in the same direction (i.e. H2D or D2H) are serialized.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Copies from host$\rightarrow$device and device$\rightarrow$host are concurrent if in different streams.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pinned memory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Pinned (or page-locked) memory will not be paged out to disk:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The GPU can safely remotely read/write the memory directly without host involvement;
        \item Only use for transfers, because it easy to run out of memory.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{info}{Asynchronous copy example: streaming workloads}
        Computations that can be performed independently, e.g. our \axpy example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Data in host memory has to be copied to the device, and the result copied back after the kernel is computed.
            \item Overlap copies with kernel calls by breaking the data into chunks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{CUDA events}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    To implement the streaming workload we have to coordinate operations on the GPU.
    CUDA events can be used for this purpose.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Synchronize tasks in different streams, e.g.:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Don't start kernel in kernel stream until data copy stream has finished;
            \item Wait until required data has finished copy from host before launching kernel.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Query status of concurrent tasks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Has kernel finished/started yet?
            \item How long did a kernel take to compute?

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Rough guidelines for concurrency}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Ideally for most workloads you don't want to rely on streams to fill the GPU with work.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A sign that the working set per GPU is not large enough;
        \item Full concurrency is difficult in practice;
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A low-level optimization strategy for the last few \%.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This isn't a hard and fast rule.
    \end{itemize}

    Streams come into their own for overlapping communication and computation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Possible to transfer data in both directions concurrently with kernel execution.
    \end{itemize}
