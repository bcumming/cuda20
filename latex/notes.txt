setup & environment
--------------------

# log in and allocate a node with GPU for 1 hour
ssh daint
salloc -C gpu

# load cuda 8
module load cudatoolkit

# loads gcc/5.3.0, which works with cuda toolkit
module load gcc

git clone https://github.com/eth-cscs/???.git

points to make
--------------------
compiling for Pascal. Currently we don't discuss nvcc much.
-arch=sm_60

--------------------
unified memory
--------------------

- the managed example is 4x slower
    - can we run nvprof and look at page faults?
    - can we contrive an example where it starts to pay off, e.g. update a handful of values in between

to profile:

srun nvprof -o managed.nvvp --unified-memory-profiling per-process-device --profile-from-start off ./managed 20
    --profile-from-start off                      : obvious
    --unified-memory-profiling per-process-device : record both CPU and GPU page faults (by default we get only GPU faults)
    -o managed.nvvp                               : name of file to save profile output in
